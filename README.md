# Biography
# I am a first year PhD student in the Lennon Lab at IU. My research interests are in 
# microbial ecology specifically microorganisms within permafrost and how climate change may
# affect dormant microbes with increased permafrost thaw. Prior to working on permafrost, during
# my undergraduate education I worked on identifying and understanding microbial communities 
# within a permanently stratified lake in NY. I am really excited to explore new ecological 
# and evolutionary concepts throughout my PhD! One thing that people may not know about me 
# is that I am obsessed with collecting sea glass, but since I now live in Indiana, I will 
# settle for geode hunting. (-: 

# Course expectations:
# I hope that this course challenges me and forces me to become comfortable with being uncomfortable (in the best way!)
# I hope that I walk away from this course with good data habits! 
# I expect that this course will help push my thinking forward in terms of how to analyze
# big datasets.
